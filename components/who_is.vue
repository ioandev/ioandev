              I grew up with a lot of freedom as a kid. I was in front of a keyboard when I was 3 and later on I hated school, especially when the internet came around which was later for me. At one point I had my own PC in my bedroom and I was able to play some online popular games at the time - Counter strike 1.6 and Metin2. There weren't many people in my country who could afford better games than this. So I was entertained. Later on I was told I have to think of work and I instinctively knew it was going to be related to computers. So I picked up a booklet on HTML and Microsoft FrontPage and I did a website with pictures of my family and descriptions of each. And that was fun. From there with encourangement from my parents and teachers I kept coding stuff. And I was spending hours on end every day. Programming replaced my gaming time.

              I grew up when the internet was transitioning from something the nerds are using, to a full blown out event in today's age where everything is about the online world, and less about the physical world.
              In over a decade I've wathed what website made it to the top, which ones are popular, and why. And then I've started replicating the success of others. And I did this for hours on end every day, because it was fun.
              If you're a creative soul you can probably relate when you come onto a website that serves you the way you want to be served it's an amazing feel isn't it? Well that's what I've done.

              Everyone online is in a rush to get what they want done, fast.

              I knew that once you reach a solid level in programming you can slow down and develop other areas of your life. I knew I had to do. So I've asked myself a couple of questions: How can I put myself in a different environment than I am now, and how can I give myself a lot of uncomfortable objectives so I become better?

              For the past few years I've been experimenting with integrating all the areas I want to work on in my life: programming, sports, hobbies, parties and travelling. This bundle of activities just doesn't work right with a 9-5 Monday to Friday schedule. You get me? So I've quit. There is too much vitality to be lost on a 9-5 job.

              It's a trap easy to escape once you put in your lifetime into perspective. And yes, it's hard. <strong>But
                what's better? Waking up to what you could've done, or to what you're about to do?</strong>

              The skills I'm going to show you are going to rid you of a lot of questions and anxiety about life. And I 100% believe you're going to see yourself in a better light years from now than what could otherwise be if you don't 100% focus on your life goals and to get everything that you want.
