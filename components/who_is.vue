            <p class="mb-2">
              I was born in a small village in the Austrian alps. It wasn't the richest or the poorest background I grew
              up in, just very simple. Becoming older, I felt like my life was heavily influenced by society's norms and
              established rules. The imparative being "Get good grades, study hard, apply for a job, be a good employee,
              live frugal and modest, marry and have kids, hold that job for 40 years, and then retire when you're 67 or
              something."
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              It didn't take me long enough until I realized that this wasn't the life I wanted to live and decided to
              take a different path: Dropping out of college, and moving to L.A. with about $16,000 in debt, I started
              to work as an intern for an international relationship advice company. Within the next two years I managed
              to become an instructor and got the opportunity to travel around the world as a coach. In the end, I
              finished four world tours and held seminars to tens of thousands of people. But most importantly, I
              learned how to look after myself without having to be reliant on someone else. So I created comfortable
              wealth for myself â€“ independently and by doing things that I ENJOYED.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              And while all of this was happening, I noticed more and more how our current system affected not just the
              old me living in its home town, but also other people all around the world and lead to frustration: People
              are being educated and brought into this system just to become mindless robots, almost machine-like, in
              deadend office jobs. Doing simple, repetitive, mundane work and wasting their best years in life. Seeing
              that I could make it and become financially independent, my mission became to transform other hungry,
              motivated "outside the box" people who KNOW they are destined for something bigger into self-succient and
              fulfilled human beings. This is where the idea of FreedomBusinessMentoring started growing its roots. And
              it changed hundreds of lives already.
