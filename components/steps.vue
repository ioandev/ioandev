            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              The ability to choose when and where you want to work from, gives you the autonomy and ability to also
              explore foreign countries, cities, sights and enjoy life. Compare this to being FORCED to commute
              through traffic and HAVING TO show up at your job at a specific date and time, day by day, week by week,
              year by year.

              #2: Financial Stability
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Money is derived from value. And value is perceived by people you are serving. So in order to achieve
              financial stability, you need to drive lots of value to people. And up to a certain point, there's a
              correlation between happiness and your wealth: By removing obstacles that make you unhappy, life becomes
              more fun (especially when there’s no need to worry about financial issues…)
            </p>

              #3: Pursuit of Passion
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              It doesn't take a genius to discover that we're much more engaged when we're doing something of meaning,
              something we're good at and something we receive positive feedback from other people. You have to work
              nonetheless, because I can promise you: If you don't, tt gets dull after a while. Believe me, I've tried
              these "downtime phases" where I just relaxed and had fun, but it didn't take long until I went back to
              hustling. Humans simply like challenges. Make sure you do something worthwhile.
